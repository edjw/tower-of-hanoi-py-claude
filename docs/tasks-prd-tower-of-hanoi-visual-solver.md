## Tasks

- [ ] **1.0 Core Algorithm Implementation**
  - [ ] 1.1 Implement recursive `hanoi_solver()` function that generates move sequence for n disks
  - [ ] 1.2 Create `Move` dataclass to represent individual disk movements (from_peg, to_peg, disk_size)
  - [ ] 1.3 Add move validation logic to ensure only valid moves are generated
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement move count calculation (2^n - 1) and progress tracking
  - [ ] 1.5 Add comprehensive docstrings explaining the recursive algorithm logic

- [ ] **2.0 Data Structure & State Management**
  - [ ] 2.1 Create `Disk` class with size, colour, and position properties
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement `Peg` class to manage disk stacks with push/pop operations
  - [ ] 2.3 Design `GameState` class to track current puzzle state and move history
  - [ ] 2.4 Add state validation methods to ensure puzzle rules are maintained
  - [ ] 2.5 Implement deep copy functionality for state preservation during animation

- [ ] **3.0 GUI Interface Development**
  - [ ] 3.1 Create main tkinter window with proper sizing and title
  - [ ] 3.2 Build input panel with disk count selection (3-10) and validation
  - [ ] 3.3 Add control buttons (Start, Pause/Resume, Reset) with proper event handling
  - [ ] 3.4 Create status panel displaying current move count and remaining moves
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement canvas area for drawing the three pegs and disks
  - [ ] 3.6 Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Space for pause/resume, R for reset)

- [ ] **4.0 Visual Animation System**
  - [ ] 4.1 Design colour-blind accessible colour palette for disk differentiation
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement disk rendering with size-proportional rectangles and colour coding
  - [ ] 4.3 Create peg rendering with clear base platforms and vertical posts
  - [ ] 4.4 Build smooth animation system using tkinter's after() method for frame updates
  - [ ] 4.5 Add animation speed controls and step-by-step mode option
  - [ ] 4.6 Implement visual feedback for current move (highlighting moving disk)
  - [ ] 4.7 Add visual polish with consistent spacing, proportions, and clean design

- [ ] **5.0 Application Integration & Polish**
  - [ ] 5.1 Integrate all components into single cohesive application class
  - [ ] 5.2 Add comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement proper application shutdown and cleanup procedures
  - [ ] 5.4 Add type hints throughout entire codebase for maintainability
  - [ ] 5.5 Write comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
  - [ ] 5.6 Optimise performance for smooth animation with larger disk counts
  - [ ] 5.7 Add logging for debugging and development purposes
  - [ ] 5.8 Create simple usage instructions within the GUI or as help dialog

## Standards to Follow

- Use British English throughout (colour, optimise, centre)
- Target audience: Python developers familiar with tkinter and recursive algorithms
- Single file structure with clear class organisation and separation of concerns
- Comprehensive type hints using Python 3.8+ typing features
- Object-oriented design principles with proper encapsulation
- No external dependencies beyond Python standard library
- Code should be under 500 lines total as per PRD success metrics
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code formatting
- Include comprehensive docstrings for educational value
- Implement accessibility considerations for colour-blind users
- Plan for smooth animation performance with efficient rendering
- Consider macOS compatibility and native look-and-feel

## Implementation Notes

- Use `tkinter.Canvas` for custom drawing of pegs and disks
- Leverage `tkinter.after()` for non-blocking animation updates
- Implement state machine pattern for game phases (setup, solving, paused, completed)
- Use `typing` module for comprehensive type annotations
- Consider using `dataclasses` for simple data structures (Move, Position)
- Implement proper MVC separation: Model (algorithm/state), View (tkinter UI), Controller (event handling)
- Add animation queue system to handle rapid move sequences smoothly
- Use configuration constants for colours, sizes, and timing parameters
- Implement graceful degradation for performance on older systems
